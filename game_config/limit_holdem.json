            "General Rule: There are the basic rules for Texas Hold'em Poker limit with a limit betting structure:\n\nIn this game, you are requested to attend 40 games with your opponent, you both are given 20 chips originally, and the guy who have more chips will win the game after 40 games, note that if your chips become 0 or negatives, you will loss the whole game. The goal of you is to obtain more chips than your opponent.  The Deck: Texas Hold'em is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, where there are 13 number cards (A,1 to K) with 4 colors.\n\nThe Blinds: The game begins with two players to the left of the dealer posting a small blind and a big blind respectively. The small blind is usually half of the big blind.\n\nDealing the Cards: Each player is then dealt two private cards known as 'hole cards' that belong to them alone.\n\nFirst Round of Betting: Starting with the player to the left of the big blind, each player can call the big blind, raise, or fold. In limit hold'em, the amount that a player can raise in the first two rounds of betting (pre-flop and flop) is set at the lower limit of the stakes structure. For instance, in a $4/$8 limit hold'em game, players can bet and raise in increments of $8 during the pre-flop and flop rounds.\n\nThe Flop: After the first round of betting, the dealer discards the top card of the deck (a move called 'burning' the card) and then deals three face-up community cards known as the flop.\n\nSecond Round of Betting: Another round of betting ensues, starting with the player to the left of the dealer. The same betting rules apply as the first round.\n\nThe Turn: The dealer burns another card and then adds a fourth face-up card to the community cards. This fourth card is known as the turn.\n\nThird Round of Betting: Another round of betting starts. In limit hold'em, the betting limit now doubles. So in our $4/$8 game example, players can now bet and raise in increments of $8.\n\nThe River: The dealer burns another card before placing a fifth and final community card face-up on the table. This card is known as the river.\n\nFinal Round of Betting: The final round of betting starts with the same rules as the third round.\n\nThe Showdown: If two or more players remain after the final round of betting, a showdown occurs. This is where players reveal their hands, and the player with the best hand wins the pot. \n Single Game Win/Draw/Lose Rule: Texas Hold'em hands are ranked from highest to lowest as follows: Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pair, One Pair, High Card.\n\nNote: If at any point a player makes a bet or a raise that no other player calls, they win the pot without revealing their hand.\n\nRotating the Dealer: After the pot is awarded, the dealer button moves one seat to the left, and the process begins anew.\nThe main difference between Limit Hold'em and other betting structures like No Limit or Pot Limit is the amount a player can bet or raise. In Limit, the amount is capped at a set amount per round. \n Whole Game Win/Draw/Lose Rule: you are requested to attend 10 games with your opponent, you both are given 50 chips originally, and the guy who have more chips will win the game after 10 games (i.e. You aim to have more chips than your original chips). \n Winning Payoff Rule:  The half of  the pot. \n Lose Payoff Rule:  The half of  the pot.
