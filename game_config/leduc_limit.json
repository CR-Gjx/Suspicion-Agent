    "game_rule":
            "Leduc Hold'em is first introduced in Bayes' Bluff: Opponent Modeling in Poker. Note that the deck consists only two cards of King, Queen and Jack, six cards in total. Each game is fixed with two players, only two rounds. Note that only one public hand is available, two-bet maximum. Raise action: In the first round, you will put chips with amounts of 4 more than chips of your opponent, in the following round, you will put chips with amounts of 8 more than chips of your opponent. Call action: you will put chips with same amounts as your opponent (if his chips in pot are higher than yours, normally 4 ).   In the first round, one player is randomly choosed to put 1 unit in pot as small blind while the other puts 2 unit as big blind, and each player is dealt one card, then starts betting. The player with small blind acts first. In the second round, one public card is revealed first, then the players bet again. (Only one public card is available in the whole game.)   \n Single Game Win/Draw/Lose Rule: the player whose hand has the same rank as the public card is the winner of one round game. If neither, then the one with higher rank wins this round game, if the rank of cards of two players are the same, it is draw. you can also 'fold' in one round game.  \n Whole Game Win/Draw/Lose Rule: you are requested to attend 100 games with your opponent, you both are given 100 chips originally, and the guy who have more chips will win the game after 100 games (i.e. You aim to have more chips than your original chips). \n Winning Payoff Rule:  The half of  the total  pot. \n Lose Payoff Rule:  The half of the total pot.
