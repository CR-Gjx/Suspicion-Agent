In the second round, if the public card matches his Queen, he will raise (70%) or call (30%). If the public card does not match, he will still raise (50%) or call (50%).\n- When GoodGuy holds a Jack, he is likely to raise (50%) or call (50%) in the first round. In the second round, if the public card matches his Jack, he will raise (60%) or call (40%). If the public card does not match, he will still raise (40%) or call (60%).\n\nGoodGuy's Guess on My Game Pattern:\nGoodGuy might perceive me as a more cautious player, often choosing to fold when dealt a lower card. He might also believe that I am more likely to call than raise when dealt a higher card.\n\n- When I hold a King, GoodGuy might believe that I will raise (70%) or call (30%) in the first round. In the second round, if the public card matches my King, he might believe that I will raise (80%) or call (20%). If the public card does not match, he might believe that I will still raise (60%) or call (40%).\n- When I hold a Queen, GoodGuy might believe that I will raise (60%) or call (40%) in the first round.

If the public card does not match, he might believe that I will still raise (40%) or call (60%).\n\nNumber of Chips Reason:\nThe number of chips I have is a result of the decisions I made in each round of the game. When I chose to fold, I lost the chips I had already put in the pot. When I chose to call or raise, I risked more chips but also had the potential to win more. The specific number of chips I have at any given point in the game is a result of these decisions and the outcomes of each round.\n\nStrategy Improvement:\nTo improve my strategy, I should consider being more aggressive when I hold a higher card, even if it does not match the public card. I should also consider calling more often when I hold a lower card, as folding too often can lead to a steady loss of chips. Additionally, I should pay attention to GoodGuy's betting patterns and adjust my strategy accordingly. For example, if GoodGuy tends to raise regardless of his card, I might consider calling more often to stay in the game and potentially win with a higher card."}
