GoodGuy, holding a Jack of Spades, decides to raise, increasing the pot to 6 chips.\n\nIn the second round, a King of Hearts is revealed as the public card. This gives board_game_expert a pair, which is a strong hand in Leduc Hold'em. Board_game_expert decides to raise, increasing the pot to 8 chips. GoodGuy, with no matching cards and a lower rank card, decides to check, matching the current bet but not raising.\n\nAt this point, board_game_expert wins the round, gaining 4 chips from the pot, while GoodGuy loses 4 chips. GoodGuy, realizing his disadvantage, decides to fold in the next action, conceding the game to board_game_expert."}}
