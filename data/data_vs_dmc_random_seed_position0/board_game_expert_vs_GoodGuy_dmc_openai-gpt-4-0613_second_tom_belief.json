After I take my action, GoodGuy might adjust his beliefs based on my action and the standard strategy. For example, if I 'raise', GoodGuy might increase the probability that I am holding a King.

{"message": "", "95_2": {"belief": "Analysis on my Cards: \nMy current best combination is a single Queen. The advantage of having a Queen is that it is the second highest card in the deck, only lower than the King.
