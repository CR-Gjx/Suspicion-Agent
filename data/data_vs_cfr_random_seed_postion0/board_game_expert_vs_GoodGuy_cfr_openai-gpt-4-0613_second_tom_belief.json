When he holds a King, he would call if he sees a raise from the opponent, which matches his action in the first round. Therefore, he might hold a King (50% probability). When he holds a Jack, he would also call if he sees a raise from the opponent, so he might also hold a Jack (50% probability). In the second round, the public card is a King and GoodGuy raised. According to his behavior pattern, when the public card matches his card, he would raise. Therefore, it is highly likely that he holds a King (100% probability).\n\nAnalysis on GoodGuy's Cards: \nBased on my belief on GoodGuy's cards, it is highly likely that he holds a King.

In the second round, I raised again, which according to GoodGuy's guess on my game pattern, he might believe that my card matches the public card. However, since the public card is a King, and he likely holds the other King, he might believe that I do not hold a King (0% probability).

Given that there are two of each card in the deck, the probability is 50% for Queen and 50% for King.\n\nAnalysis on GoodGuy's Cards: \nIf GoodGuy holds a Queen or King, his best combination would be if the public card matches his card, giving him a pair. The advantage of holding a Queen or King is that they are higher ranks than my Jack, so if the public card does not match either of our cards, he would win the round. However, the disadvantage is that if the public card matches my card, he would lose the round.\n\nPotential GoodGuy's current believes about your cards: \nGiven my history of actions, GoodGuy might believe that I hold a Queen or King, as I tend to raise more often with these cards. However, since I have not yet made a move in this round, he does not have any new information to update his beliefs. Therefore, based on his guess on my game pattern, he might believe that I have a Jack with a probability of 40%, a Queen with a probability of 30%, and a King with a probability of 30%."}}
