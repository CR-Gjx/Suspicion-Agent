{"message": "", "1_0": "Apologies for the confusion, but there seems to be a lack of specific information about the previous games played with GoodGuy. Without this data, it's impossible to accurately infer GoodGuy's game pattern, guess on your game pattern, reason for the number of chips, reflex, and strategy improvement. \n\nHowever, I can provide a general strategy for Leduc Hold'em Poker Limit:\n\n1. If you hold a King, it's generally a good idea to raise or call in the first round, as it's the highest card. If the public card is a King, you have the highest possible hand and should definitely raise.\n\n2. If you hold a Queen, it's a bit riskier. You might want to call in the first round and see what the public card is. If it's a Queen, you should raise. If it's a King, you might want to fold unless you think your opponent is bluffing.\n\n3. If you hold a Jack, it's the riskiest. You might want to fold in the first round unless you think your opponent is bluffing. If the public card is a Jack, you should raise.\n\n4. Pay attention to your opponent's betting patterns. If they always raise when they have a King, for example, you can use this information to your advantage.\n\n5. Remember that bluffing is a key part of poker. Sometimes, it's worth it to raise even if you don't have a good hand in order to trick your opponent into folding.\n\n6. Finally, keep track of your chips and make sure you don't run out. It's better to fold and lose a small amount of chips than to call and lose a lot.\n\nPlease provide more specific information about the previous games if you want a more detailed analysis."}

{"message": "", "104_1": "GoodGuy's game pattern:\n\n1. When GoodGuy holds a Jack:\n   - If no public card is revealed, GoodGuy tends to fold when the opponent raises (probability 80%), and calls when the opponent calls (probability 20%).\n   - If the public card is a Jack, GoodGuy tends to raise (probability 90%) or call (probability 10%).\n   - If the public card is a Queen or King, GoodGuy tends to fold (probability 70%) or call (probability 30%).\n\n2.

However, there were also times when I made wrong decisions, such as calling when I should have folded, which resulted in losing chips.\n\nStrategy Improvement:\n\nTo improve my strategy, I should pay more attention to the public card and GoodGuy's actions. If the public card is a higher rank than my card, I should consider folding. If GoodGuy raises, I should consider whether he might have a matching card or a higher-ranking card. If I hold a higher-ranking card, I should consider raising to increase the pot. I should also consider bluffing occasionally to confuse GoodGuy and make him make wrong decisions."}
