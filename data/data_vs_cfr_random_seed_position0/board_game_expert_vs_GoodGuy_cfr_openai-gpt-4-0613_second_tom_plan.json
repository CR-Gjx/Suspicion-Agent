My winning rate is 33.33% (if the public card is a Jack), my losing rate is 33.33% (if the public card is a Queen), and my draw rate is 33.33% (if the public card is a King).\n- If GoodGuy holds a Jack, he is likely to fold (80%) or call (20%). My winning rate is 0% (if the public card is a King or Queen), my losing rate is 0%, and my draw rate is 100% (if the public card is a Jack).\n\nPlan 2: Raise\n- If GoodGuy holds a King, he is likely to call (70%) or raise (30%).

My winning rate is 0% (if the public card is a King or Queen), my losing rate is 0%, and my draw rate is 100% (if the public card is a Jack).\n\nPlan 3: Fold\n- If I fold, I will lose the 1 chip I have already put in the pot. My winning rate is 0%, my losing rate is 100%, and my draw rate is 0%.\n\nPotential believes about the number of winning and lose payoffs for each plan:\n\nPlan 1: Call\n- If I win, the winning payoff would be 2.5 chips (half of the 5-chip pot).\n- If I lose, the losing payoff would be 2.5 chips.\n\nPlan 2: Raise\n- If I win, the winning payoff would be 3.5 chips (half of the 7-chip pot).\n- If I lose, the losing payoff would be 3.5 chips.\n\nPlan 3: Fold\n- If I fold, I will lose the 1 chip I have already put in the pot. There is no winning payoff.\n\nEstimate Expected Chips Gain for Each Plan:\n\nPlan 1: Call\n- Expected Chips Gain = 33.33% * 2.5 - 66.67% * 2.5 = -0.83 chips\n\nPlan 2: Raise\n- Expected Chips Gain = 33.33% * 3.5 - 66.67% * 3.5 = -1.17 chips\n\nPlan 3: Fold\n- Expected Chips Gain = 0% * 0 - 100% * 1 = -1 chip\n\nPlan Selection:\n\nBased on the estimated expected chips gain for each plan, I should choose Plan 1: Call. This plan has the highest expected chips gain (-0.83 chips), which means it is the least likely to result in a loss. This plan also aligns with my strategy improvement of being more cautious when GoodGuy decides to call or raise."}}

This would allow me to win the pot without having to reveal my card. I could say, \"I'm feeling lucky this round.\"\n\nPlan 2: Fold\n- If I fold, I would lose the chips I have already put into the pot, but I would avoid losing more chips if GoodGuy holds a King. I could say, \"I think I'll sit this one out.\"\n\nPlan 3: Check\n- If I check, I would pass the action to GoodGuy without adding more chips to the pot. This would allow me to see GoodGuy's next action before making my decision. I could say, \"Your move, GoodGuy.\"\n\nPotential GoodGuy's actions and Estimate Winning/Lose/Draw Rate for Each Plan:\n\nPlan 1: Raise\n- If GoodGuy holds a Jack (40% probability), he might fold (80% probability), resulting in a win for me. If he calls (20% probability), it would be a draw.\n- If GoodGuy holds a Queen (60% probability), he might fold (60% probability), resulting in a win for me. If he calls (40% probability), it would be a loss for me.\n- Overall, the winning rate for Plan 1 is 0.4*0.8 + 0.6*0.6 = 0.56, the losing rate is 0.6*0.4 = 0.24, and the draw rate is 0.4*0.2 = 0.08.\n\nPlan 2: Fold\n- If I fold, I would lose regardless of GoodGuy's card. The losing rate for Plan 2 is 1.\n\nPlan 3: Check\n- If GoodGuy holds a Jack (40% probability), he might check (50% probability), resulting in a draw. If he raises (50% probability), it would be a loss for me.\n- If GoodGuy holds a Queen (60% probability), he might check (50% probability), resulting in a loss for me. If he raises (50% probability), it would be a loss for me.\n- Overall, the losing rate for Plan 3 is 0.4*0.5 + 0.6*1 = 0.8, and the draw rate is 0.4*0.5 = 0.2.\n\nPotential believes about the number of winning and lose payoffs for each plan:\n\nPlan 1: Raise\n- After the action, chips in the pot: 6. If win, the winning payoff would be 3. If lose, the lose payoff would be 3.\n\nPlan 2: Fold\n- After the action, chips in the pot: 2. If lose, the lose payoff would be 1.\n\nPlan 3: Check\n- After the action, chips in the pot: 2. If lose, the lose payoff would be 1.\n\nEstimate Expected Chips Gain for Each Plan:\n\nPlan 1: Raise\n- Expected chips gain = winning rate * winning payoff - losing rate * lose payoff = 0.56 * 3 - 0.24 * 3 = 0.96\n\nPlan 2: Fold\n- Expected chips gain = -1 (since I would lose the chips I have already put into the pot)\n\nPlan 3: Check\n- Expected chips gain = -0.8 * 1 = -0.8\n\nPlan Selection:\n\nBased on the estimated expected chips gain for each plan, I should choose Plan 1: Raise, as it has the highest expected chips gain. This plan also aligns with my strategy improvement to occasionally bluff to confuse GoodGuy and make him make wrong decisions."}}
