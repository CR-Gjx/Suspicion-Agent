If he holds a King, his best combination in the current round is a King, which is higher than the public card, Queen. If he holds a Jack, his best combination is a Jack, which is lower than the public card, Queen. Therefore, if he holds a King, he has the advantage of potentially winning or drawing the game. If he holds a Jack, he is at a disadvantage and likely to lose.\n\nPotential board_game_expert's current believes about your cards: \nIn the first round, I chose to call after board_game_expert raised. According to board_game_expert's guess on my game pattern, he believes I would like to raise when I hold a King, Queen, or Jack.
