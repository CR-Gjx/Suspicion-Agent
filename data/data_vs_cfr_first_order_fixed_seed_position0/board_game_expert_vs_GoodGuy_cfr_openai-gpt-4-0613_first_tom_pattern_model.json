However, we can make some assumptions:\n\n1st Round: \n- If GoodGuy holds a Queen, he might 'check' (100% probability based on the single game played). \n\n2nd Round: \n- If GoodGuy holds a Queen and the public card is a King, he might 'call' when the opponent raises (100% probability based on the single game played). \n\nNumber of chips reason: \nIn the first game, I won 6 chips because I had a pair of Kings, which is higher than GoodGuy's Queen. GoodGuy decided to 'call' my 'raise', which added to the pot that I won. \n\nReflex: \nMy actions in the previous game were correct. I 'called' in the first round, which was a safe move considering I had a King. In the second round, I 'raised' after seeing the public card was a King, giving me a pair. GoodGuy 'called' my 'raise', which increased the pot that I won. \n\nStrategy Improvement: \nBased on the single game played, GoodGuy seems to play safe in the first round and is willing to 'call' in the second round even when he doesn't have a pair or a higher card. To exploit this, I could 'raise' more often in the second round when I have a high card or a pair.

For example, if GoodGuy tends to raise when he has a King, I should be more cautious when he raises. I should also consider the rank of my card and the public card when deciding whether to call, raise, or fold. Additionally, I should try to manage my chips more effectively, such as not calling high bets when I have a low rank card."}
{"message": "", "97_1": "GoodGuy's game pattern: \n\nIn the 1st round, when GoodGuy holds a King, he tends to raise (70%) or call (30%). When GoodGuy holds a Queen, he tends to call (60%) or raise (40%). When GoodGuy holds a Jack, he tends to fold (50%), call (30%), or raise (20%). \n\nIn the 2nd round, when GoodGuy holds a King and the public card is a King, he tends to raise (80%) or call (20%). When GoodGuy holds a Queen and the public card is a Queen, he tends to raise (70%) or call (30%). When GoodGuy holds a Jack and the public card is a Jack, he tends to raise (60%) or call (40%). If the public card does not match his hand, GoodGuy tends to check (50%) or fold (50%).\n\nNumber of chips reason: \n\nThe number of chips I have is a result of my decisions in each round of the game. When I choose to raise or call, I risk losing more chips if I don't win the round. When I choose to fold, I minimize my losses but also give up the chance to win the round. The number of chips I win or lose in each game also depends on GoodGuy's decisions. If he chooses to raise, I could lose more chips if I decide to call or raise and don't win the round. If he chooses to fold, I win the round and gain chips.\n\nReflex: \n\nLooking back at my actions, there were times when I made the right decision and times when I made the wrong decision. For example, in the 84th game, I made the right decision to raise when I had a pair, which led me to win the game. However, in the 87th game, I made the wrong decision to fold when I had a King, which led me to lose the game.\n\nStrategy Improvement: \n\nTo improve my strategy, I need to be more observant of GoodGuy's actions and adjust my decisions accordingly. If he tends to raise when he has a King, I should be more cautious when deciding to call or raise. If he tends to fold when he has a Jack, I should be more aggressive in raising. I should also consider the public card when making my decisions. If the public card matches my hand, I should be more confident in raising. If the public card does not match my hand, I should be more cautious and consider folding. I should also manage my chips wisely and not risk too many chips in one round."}
