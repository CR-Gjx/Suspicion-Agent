This means that my best combination is a single Jack, as there is no match with the public card. The advantage of my card is that if the next public card is a Jack, I will have a pair, which is a stronger combination. However, this is dependent on the next public card and is not guaranteed. \n\nBelief on GoodGuy's cards: \nIn the first round, GoodGuy decided to raise, which according to his behavior pattern, suggests that he might be holding a King (70% probability) or a Queen (40% probability). However, since I am holding the Jack and the public card is a Queen, there is only one Queen left in the deck. Therefore, the probability of GoodGuy holding a Queen is lower. \n\nIn the current round, GoodGuy decided to check. According to his behavior pattern, when the public card doesn't match his card, he tends to call (60%) or fold (40%). Since he checked, it's likely that his card doesn't match the public card. Therefore, he might be holding a King (60% probability) or a Jack (40% probability). \n\nIn total, considering GoodGuy's actions and behavior pattern, I believe he is more likely to have a King (65% probability) or a Jack (35% probability). \n\nAnalysis on GoodGuy's Cards: \nIf GoodGuy is holding a King, his best combination in the current round is a single King. The advantage of his card is that it is the highest-ranking card in the game. If the next public card is a King, he will have a pair, which is a stronger combination. \n\nIf GoodGuy is holding a Jack, his best combination in the current round is a single Jack. The advantage of his card is that if the next public card is a Jack, he will have a pair, which is a stronger combination. However, since I am also holding a Jack, the probability of the next public card being a Jack is lower. \n\nIn conclusion, GoodGuy's advantage is dependent on the next public card and is not guaranteed. However, if he is holding a King, he has a higher chance of winning the round."}}

However, the advantage of my card is that if the public card turns out to be a Jack, I will have a pair which is the highest possible hand in this game. If the public card is a King or Queen, my hand will be lower rank.

According to my observation of GoodGuy's behavior pattern, when he holds a King, he tends to raise (70%) or call (30%). When he holds a Queen, he tends to call (60%) or raise (40%). When he holds a Jack, he tends to fold (50%), call (30%), or raise (20%). Given that he raised, it is more likely that he is holding a King (70%) or a Queen (40%) than a Jack (20%).
