If the public card is a Jack, he will have a strong hand in the second round. \n\nPotential GoodGuy's current believes about my cards: \nIn the first round, I have not yet made a move. According to GoodGuy's belief about my game pattern, when I hold a King, I am likely to raise (80%) or call (20%). When I hold a Queen, I am likely to call (60%) or raise (40%). When I hold a Jack, I am likely to call (50%) or fold (50%). Given that I have not yet acted, GoodGuy might believe that I have a King (40%), a Queen (30%), or a Jack (30%)."}}
